## Abstract

This document describes the process for creating, reviewing, and implementing Tur Enhancement Proposals (EPs).
EPs are the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input, and documenting design
decisions.

## Rationale

To maintain the architectural integrity of Tur and adhere to the **Council Framework**, major changes require
careful consideration. EPs provide a structured way to:

1. **Falsify** ideas before implementation (Popper).
2. Ensure **Clarity** in design (Feynman).
3. Maintain a history of decisions (**Harmony**).

## The EP Workflow

1. **Draft:** The author creates a new file in `design/proposals/` using the template.
2. **Review:** The proposal is reviewed by the maintainers (The Council).
3. **Status Change:**
    * **Accepted:** The design is approved.
    * **Rejected:** The design is flawed or misaligned.
    * **Deferred:** Good idea, but not now.
    * **Superseded:** Replaced by a newer EP.
    * **Withdrawn:** The author withdrew the proposal.
4. **Implementation:** The code is written.
5. **Final:** The feature is released.

## EP Types

* **Standards Track:** New features or behavioral changes.
* **Process:** Meta-EPs (like this one) describing procedures.
* **Informational:** Design issues or general guidelines.
